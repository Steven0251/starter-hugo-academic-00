abstract: At present, in the process of image synthesis information acquisition
  of urban virtual geographic scene, there is information complexity. The
  existing acquisition technology is easy to disturb in the process of
  information positioning and transmission, resulting in large acquisition delay
  and affecting the final synthesis quality of the image. In response to the
  above problems, the method of synchronous information acquisition for urban
  virtual geographic scene image synthesis based on wireless network technology
  is studied. Based on the construction of an urban virtual geographic
  environment, the spatial localization of the sign target of geographic scene
  image synthesis is carried out, and the optical flow method is used to
  register the urban geographic scene images. Based on the greedy algorithm of
  the beacon to design the synchronous wireless network route for urban virtual
  scene image synthesis, and after the grid division of the wireless network in
  the synthesis information acquisition area, the packets of each acquisition
  node are acquired and transmitted according to the designed wireless network
  route to realize the synchronous acquisition of image synthesis information.
  The comparison experimental data show that the acquisition delay of the
  studied information synchronization acquisition method is less than 0.5â€‰s, the
  acquisition synchronization rate is significantly improved, and the quality of
  the synthesized images is better by applying the information acquired by the
  method, and the practical use is better.
