abstract: This paper uses the split-step Fourier method to study the dynamic
  transmission of positive and negative Airy pulses, which are different with
  time, in a media with two closely spaced zero-dispersion wavelengths. The
  study is under the influence of self-phase modulation (SPM), intrapulse Ramen
  scattering (IRS) and self-steepening (SS). We study the waveform and
  spectrogram of those two kinds of Airy pulses in the double zero-dispersion
  media, as well as their three-dimensional evolution diagrams. Then, we find
  that in the same condition, the positive Airy pulse can gain a broader
  supercontinuum and negative Airy pulse can acquire a flatter one. This paper
  is important on how to choose suitable initial parameters of inputting pulse
  to optimize supercontinuum.
